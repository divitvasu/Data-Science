## About

A collection of projects covering fundamentals of Data Science such as hypothesis testing, regression. Below are the details for each individual project in this repo.

## Simple Linear Regression

This is a Shiny App, meant to demonstrate *Simple Linear Regression*. This can be executed by installing R binaries, followed by R Studio. Upon launch, the applications provides a prompt for selecting the excel file containing the dependent and independent variables. A sample file and the corresponding output have been included.

## Multiple Linear Regression

This is a R markdown project, meant to demonstrate *Multiple Linear Regression*. This can be executed by installing R binaries, followed by R Studio. Although, these tests have been performed using the in-built *trees* dataset, a sample CSV has also been uploaded, which can also be used with some minor changes in the code.

## T-Tests

This is a R markdown project, meant to demonstrate hypothesis testing by the means of *one sample-t test*, *two sample-t test* and *paired t-test*. This can be executed by installing R binaries, followed by R Studio.

## Anova Tests

These are R markdown projects, showing *one-way Anova* and *Two-way Anova tests*, with outputs included. The files can be run using R studio as mentioned above.
